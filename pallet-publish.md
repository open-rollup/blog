**Open Rollup Brings zk Programs to Polkadot**

Zero-knowledge proof systems are increasingly used in blockchains, where zk-rollup is increasingly used to solve the scalability problem of blockchains.

Unlike many current zk-rollup solutions, which are a centralized organization that collects transactions, generates proofs, and then submits the execution results and proofs to the blockchain, Open Rollup is an open zk-rollup framework where we do not run our own servers to interact with users, but only provide a set of useful frameworks for application developers who want to participate in the blockchain.

Open Rollup consists of two main parts, a Pallet on the Substrate chain and a set of off-chain zk application development tools.

This project is proudly supported by the web3 Foundation's Grants Program, and we are very happy to have completed our first proposal, the Pallet part of the Substrate chain. Currently this Pallet supports Currency, Fungible, Nonfungible tokens in Substrate, and supports Miden-vm applications's registration and verification.
